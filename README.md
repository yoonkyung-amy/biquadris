# Biquadris

Biquadris is a two-player twist on the classic game Tetris, developed as a group project (3 members). The game features both text-based and graphical displays, multiple difficulty levels, special actions, and command-line customization.

## 🕹️ Game Overview

- Each player has an 11×15 board.
- Blocks fall from the top of the board.
- Players take turns placing blocks; the next block for each opponent is previewed.
- Clearing multiple rows can trigger special actions that affect the opponent.

## 🔧 Features

- **7 Block Types**: I, J, L, O, S, Z, T
- **Multiple Levels**: Different block-generation strategies and added difficulty
- **Special Actions**:
  - `blind`: Hides part of the opponent’s board
  - `heavy`: Makes movement more difficult
  - `force`: Changes the opponent’s current block

## 🎯 Project Focus

This project emphasizes:
- Object-oriented programming
- Turn-based game logic
- User interaction through command-line and graphical interfaces
